# CS50's Codes and Answers
 Repository to store code from CS50 class codes, labs and problem sets

 - from week 1 to week 4, all codes were made in 2023
 - however, from week 5 and after, all codes were made in 2024
 - this means that the first half might be outdated a little because apparently there's no labs in 2024
 - I will still be doing the old course so i can finish it and maybe if there's different coding activities i'll jump in the new one

- currently posting this to keep myself up to date with my coding
